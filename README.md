# SurTarang
An interactive system developed as part of Brain Body music course at Georgia Tech Centre for Music Technology offered during Fall 2021. \

SurTarang is an interactive and generative music system enabling musicians to control several parameters of the accompanying instruments without the need to touch or manipulate physical interfaces. Sur Tarang translated body and mind signals (bio signals via EEG) as well as automatic gesture recognition into the sounds of the accompanying instruments. A demo of the system can be seen at - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88lU0gK0yoM. \
For a detailed explaination of the different modules, the flow and functioning of the system, please refer to the documentation in the paper - SurTarangPaper.pdf in the root directory.
