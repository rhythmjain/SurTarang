# SurTarang
An interactive system developed as part of Brain Body music course at Georgia Tech Centre for Music Technology offered during Fall 2021. It was jointly developed by Nitin Hugar, Rhythm Jain and Thiago R Roque. 

SurTarang is an interactive and generative music system enabling musicians to control several parameters of the accompanying instruments without the need to touch or manipulate physical interfaces. Sur Tarang translated body and mind signals (bio signals via EEG) as well as automatic gesture recognition into the sounds of the accompanying instruments. A demo of the system can be seen at - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88lU0gK0yoM. For demonstrating the capabilities of Sur Tarang, we have chosen Raag Bhairav which is a morning raga/raag historically believed to induce meditative and peaceful states in the performer as well as the listener. 

You can also refer to SurTarangSlides.pptx (present in the root directory) to get a quick explanation of the different modules and flow of SurTarang. For a detailed explaination of the same, please refer to the documentation in the paper SurTarangPaper.pdf (present in the root directory). A schematic of the basic components of this system are displayed below.
