# SurTarang
SurTarang is an interactive and generative music system enabling musicians to control several parameters of the accompanying instruments without the need to touch or manipulate physical interfaces. Sur Tarang translated body and mind signals (bio signals via EEG) as well as automatic gesture recognition into the sounds of the accompanying instruments.
